# Project | Europe Migration

## Introduction

The project looks into migration in Europe and its affects on the labour market. In each of the EU country I analyze the relationship between nationals employed & unemployed and foreigners employed & unemployed. National workers are those who have a citizenship in the residing country and foreign workers do not.

The project tries to answer the following questions: 

1) How has migration in Europe affected the labour market?
2) How is Europe handling migrant integration? 
3) Which European country is doing the best job?
